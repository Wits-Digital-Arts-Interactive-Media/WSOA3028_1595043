<h2><u>IXD Process</u></h2>
<h3><u>Goal Alignment</u></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
    My goal for the website overall is to achieve a simple, engineering aesthetic that easily communicates all relevant information to my users. 
    Information that doesn't belong in a specific category should not be found and my users should not have a hard time finding what they desire so my structure is similar to that of a 5-ary tree like that of coding.

    From the above, my main focus of users are Engineers however still pleasing enough for digital artists. 
    So, a simple, calm, and logical target audience is my desire. 
    What I necessarily want my users to see is a unique but simple, not over-the-top where the information they desire is easy to access and interact with.

    My main focus of the website is my portfolio, Essays, and Blog posts accompanied by my profile, Design, and Experiments that I had performed in my own time. 
    The Blog posts and portfolio showing my progress in life is the most important aspect of the website. 
    The experiments performed along with the Blogs and portfolio are the most interesting.

<h3><u>Interface Elements</u></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
    •	Input Controls: After looking further into what exactly there is, I will be using a mixture of buttons and text fields for both searching and communication with me through my profile and possibly on my blog posts.
    •	Navigational Components: A usage of sliders for blog posts and portfolios, possible search fields, pagination for my blog posts, and icons for any externally sourced information
    •	Informational Components: A definite usage of icons will be found along with the possibility of tooltips.

<h3><u><strong>Reflect  on how your original wireframes hold up in line with this process.</strong></u></h3>    
<p style="text-align: justify;">
    After going through the IXD process, there will be definite changes to my wireframe. 
    Compared to my original, it was missing important navigational components and input controls that would have made it easier and more logical to use. 
    This is a new process for me, and I am glad that the IXD theory has helped me understand what could be done better.

<h3><u><strong> Reflection for Website 1 </strong></u></h3>
<h3><u><strong> Where have you struggled?</strong></u></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
    At first, understanding how to set up each page and get the website running was my issue but eventually, I overcame it. 
    From there onwards I did not struggle as much as I thought I would. 
    Being familiar with coding helped a lot as many resources helped in achieve what I desired from the website. 
    However, understanding the concepts was a bit of a challenge mainly because managing time to go through the material has been a bit of a short fall for me.
</p>
<h3><u><strong> What are you proud of?</strong></u></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
    The fact that my ambition for making this website is tenfold compared to other things in life. 
    I truly lose track of time when I both experiment on my website and experiments as I'm constantly trying to learn new things that I can do, albeit most of the time silly things like background videos. 
</p>
<h3><u><strong> What do you want to change going forward?</strong></u></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
    I want to ensure that I understand the concepts given better as they will be paramount later on, so I should first sort out my schedule. 
    Lastly, I also don't just want to be plain and simple. 
    I do want more life to my website aesthetic but unfortunately, I need CSS for what I want to do so I look forward to the moment I can use it.

<h3><u>Goal Alignment</u></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
    My goal for the website overall is to achieve a simple, engineering aesthetic that easily communicates all relevant information to my users. 
    Information that doesn't belong in a specific category should not be found and my users should not have a hard time finding what they desire so my structure is similar to that of a 5-ary tree like that of coding.

    From the above, my main focus of users are Engineers however still pleasing enough for digital artists. 
    So, a simple, calm, and logical target audience is my desire. 
    What I necessarily want my users to see is a unique but simple, not over-the-top where the information they desire is easy to access and interact with.

    My main focus of the website is my portfolio, Essays, and Blog posts accompanied by my profile, Design, and Experiments that I had performed in my own time. 
    The Blog posts and portfolio showing my progress in life is the most important aspect of the website. 
    The experiments performed along with the Blogs and portfolio are the most interesting.

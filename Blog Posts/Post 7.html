    <div style="text-align: center;"><h1>Week 9 - Blog Post 7</h1></div>
    <div style="text-align: center;"><h1>Internet and the Just Society</h1></div>
    <div style="text-align: center;"><h3>Student Name: Ettienne Swart</h3></div>
    <div style="text-align: center;"><h3>Student Number: 1595043</h3></div>
    <div style="text-align: center;"><h1>Topic: Knowledge can change foundations</h1></div>
   

    <p style="text-align: justify center;">After going through the reading material prescribed to us, I can say with certainty that if an individual is not careful in the Digital world, a rude awakening is what they will be met with.</p>
    
    <p style="text-align: justify center;">With my recent blog regarding “Internet Access is a Human Right”, I had a more negative viewpoint on it. Although I can agree with the fact that it can help benefit people in less fortunate situations such as lack of access to education, labor market, financial gains etc., it is rather who provides this is what I am more concerned about. Information is valuable but can be manipulated to benefit themselves, not the people. A good example is North Korea where although there is internet access, only less than a percent of its population have access to the global internet because the government gave them permission. They control what their people see and if you know what North Korea is like and have seen what many of the citizens (but fortunately some that don’t) believe that the western world is the enemy, only listen to us, the government. This is where internet access, a tool that can both be wonderful and terrible, perform exceptionally in the latter. So by trying to provide access to all, who has the say as to what each person can and cannot do? The people, or the government who could easily change or control what is on the internet for its citizens to see? In South Africa, there are things that can’t be said, done or spoken about. But that does not mean that we listen to the whims of everything the government say. Many parties try to convince their audiences that the other parties are wrong, yet if all the people of South Africa had internet access to education that is not manipulated, then we would be in a very different state soon. I am grateful that I have received education and internet access yet can confirm that certain parts of the internet like social media, play large roles in shaping who you are.</p>
  
    <p style="text-align: justify center;">As a junior web developer, I cannot stand the mere thought that the internet should be used maliciously. I have seen many websites who have no shame, websites that should never have seen the light, and human beings that either did amazing deeds, or terrible deeds. South Africa has quit a high unemployment and many problems regarding basic human needs. So, as a South African, why would I want to be malicious? Is it because of my fortunate upbringing? My education? My morals? I am not sure, but from this I can say with certainty that if I do aim for web development as my job, I will not let malicious activities go unnoticed.       </p>

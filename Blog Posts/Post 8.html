    <div style="text-align: center;"><h1>Digital inequalities in the age of Artificial Intelligence</h1></div>
    <div style="text-align: center;"><h3>Student Name: Ettienne Swart</h3></div>
    <div style="text-align: center;"><h3>Student Number: 1595043</h3></div>
    
    <div style="text-align: center;"><h2><u>Introduction</u></h2></div>
   

    <p style="text-align: center justify"itemprop="description">For my choice, I have chosen to look into Lutz 2019 Digital inequalities in the age of artificial intelligence [1]. From the article, It aim to discuss the problems of the digital age. As such, I hope to learn a lot from this.</p>
    
    <div style="text-align: center;"><h2><u>Body</u></h2></div>
    <div style="text-align: center;"><h3><u>Hierarchy of empires</u></h3></div>
    <p style="text-align: center justify"itemprop="description"><b>“Traditionally disadvantaged citizens are similarly disadvantaged on the Internet, for example by having limited access to technology, restricted use opportunities, and by lacking important digital skills (Hargittai, 2002; Hargittai & Hinnant, 2008; Robinson, 2009; Sims, 2014; Zillien & Hargittai, 2009). Consequently, excluded population groups do not reap the benefits from information technology to the same extent as more privileged groups (Blank & Lutz, 2018; Van Deursen & Helsper, 2015). Therefore, optimistic claims that the Internet would create widespread social mobility and would lead to less stratified societies have been challenged by digital inequalities scholars (Norris, 2001).”</b></p>
    <p style="text-align: center justify"itemprop="description">The above paragraph is not surprising at all. The earliest kingdom was in 3000 B.C.E in Kengir, also known as Sumer, and Kemet, also known as ancient Egypt. Kingdoms have hierarchies. Of course, this all varies for generation and country like how Egypt has Pharaohs, while say the British royal family has kings or Queens. Nevertheless, there were shall we say classes that everyone had in these kingdoms. Peasants, slave, aristocrats, Dukes, and the list goes on and on. Yet what do they all have in common? They all have access to certain luxuries. Peasants must do hard labour to make ends meet. Nobles trade goods and luxury items or make contracts etc. which are less laborious than the classes below them and the highest rank which are kings or Pharaohs and more reap from the classes below. So, everyone has their ‘role’ in life. Can you call it a king if everyone is a king? The tools make the man as they say and because of the twisted machinations of the world and how it runs, people who aren’t in those higher classes will struggle to reap the same rewards the ‘king’ reaps. It is stupid to believe that the tool (internet) would make the kingdom reshape to benefit all. Humanity has had this system for thousands of years and it “works”. Why would the higher classes “fix” it when it works? I apologize for the negative outlook on this, but I will not be joining fools in the “ignorance is bliss” daydream. </p>
    
    <div style="text-align: center;"><h3><u>Digital and Physical world problems</u></h3></div>
    <p style="text-align: center justify"itemprop="description"><b>“With increasing Internet penetration in the late 1990s and 2000s, certain access gaps, (e.g., race and gender gaps) have largely closed in countries such as the United States (Hargittai & Hinnant, 2008), where around 90% of the population have access to the Internet (Pew, 2018a). Nevertheless, the global divide (Norris, 2001) is still very large, mirroring global economic inequalities (International Telecommunications Union, 2017). Moreover, within richer countries certain population groups struggle to access the Inter net, particularly individuals living in rural areas, those aged 65+, and those with less than a high school degree (Pew, 2018a). Thus, scholars have warned against abandoning the study of Internet access (Robinson, 2009; Van Deursen & Van Dijk, 2019)”</b></p>
    <p style="text-align: center justify"itemprop="description">To tell a person the history of the internet and all its affects it had on life would require multiple libraries to hold the information. The internet was originally nothing in both design and purpose than it is today. With the information provided in this quote, it is true that although many have access to this tool, not all of them can use it. The author points out that the digital world mirrors the real economic world, and they are right as to even benefit from what the digital economy has to offer, many real world requirements are needed. </p>
  
    <div style="text-align: center;"><h3><u>Age is not just a number.</u></h3></div>
    
    <p style="text-align: center justify"itemprop="description"><b>“These studies have shown differentiated inequalities along socio-economic lines. Blank and Groselj (2014), for example, in an in-depth survey of 1,498 British Internet users, identi fied 10 types of Internet use, showing how age, gender and education have a substantial effect on how often individuals perform each type. Generally, young, male and educated users have the highest use frequency for most of these types.”</b></p>
    <p style="text-align: center justify"itemprop="description"><b>“Other second-level digital divide studies have focused on online participation and social media, differentiating active content creators from passive consumers and identifying the user characteristics of specific social media platforms (e.g., Blank, 2013; Blank & Lutz, 2017; Brake, 2014; Correa, 2010; Hargittai, 2007, 2015; Hargittai & Walejko, 2008; Hoffmann, Lutz, & Meckel, 2015; Schradie, 2011). The findings here are mixed, not allowing for strong associations between socio-economic status and online participation or social media use (Lutz, 2016). However, across most studies, age has proven to be a strong predictor of online participation and social media use, and some platforms are clearly gendered (Pew, 2018b)”</b></p>
   
    <p style="text-align: center justify"itemprop="description">It should be noted that this could be very different in a hundred years from now, yet now it is valid information.  Many factors in todays world contribute to the young users being more active, male and educated users reasons as to why they are so active will vary from person to person. Yet nevertheless with information like this, the second quote gives an explanation as to why even though there are not any clear links, age still plays a roll in online participation and social media. This could range from friendships to seeking existing knowledge without the drive to discover it on their own. Though seeing that platforms are gendered is not surprising. Male users won’t go looking for barbie clothes and Female users wont go looking for beard shaving cream.</p>
   
    <p style="text-align: center justify"itemprop="description"><b>“Blank and Lutz (2018) make the important point that third-level digital divide research should not only study the ben efits from Internet use but also the harms. However, the literature on harms differs from the one on benefits, making holistic approaches more difficult. While research on risks and harms is prominent in the children and media as well as the privacy literature, research on benefits is inspired by uses and gratifications theory, media appropriation, and technology acceptance (Blank & Lutz, 2018). Beyond tangible outcomes, digital inequalities scholarship has started to look at intangible outcomes such as social wellbeing, showing how perceptions—especially of belongingness—affect wellbeing more than Internet use and skills (Büchi, Festic, & Latzer, 2018). Similarly, the psychological literature about the relationship between smartphone screen time and wellbeing has shown that these effects tend to be small and follow a goldilocks pattern (Orben & Przybylski, 2019; Przybylski & Weinstein, 2013).”</b></p>
    <p style="text-align: center justify"itemprop="description"><b>“They show how disadvantaged population groups suffer most from large-scale surveillance based on their digital traces. For example, underprivileged users are more likely to fall victim to fraudulent offers or predatory websites (Madden et al., 2017). According to an interviewee in Eubanks (2014), “poor women are the test subjects for surveillance technology,” as they are disproportionately monitored by the government. A key argument in the emerging literature on the social implications of AI is that data-driven algorithms often reinforce established structural inequalities rather than shaking them up (Noble, 2018). Research on the third-level digital divide should include digital traces, algorithmic surveillance, and data-based discrimination into its “syllabus.” “</b></p>
   
    <p style="text-align: center justify"itemprop="description">So that is quite interesting regarding the first quote. That the benefit is not about children or betterment of everyone, rather about benefiting their needs not anyone else’s. Interesting as that is not what it should only be used for. Now do you see why I talked about the kingdom’s similarity. Then with the second quote, it addresses many problems of how with such a sheer magnitude that the internet is, large scale surveillance for both malicious and non-malicious will be fighting to stop one another. Compromises have to be made and AI are programmed to do things, they cant think for themselves, just do what they are told is right or wrong.</p>
   
    <div style="text-align: center;"><h2><u>Conclusion</u></h2></div>
    <p style="text-align: center justify"itemprop="description">In the end, the article shows that internet access is not that simple and is much more complex than one would expect. From what I have gathered, it is clear that research into it Is of the utmost importance as many problems can be found surrounding the topic.</p>

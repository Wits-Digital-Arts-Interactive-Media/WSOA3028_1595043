<h2 style="left: auto;">Folder Structure</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify">
    Looking at my folder structure, ill be keeping it as 4 separate folders. 
    One is the home folder containing the following three folders: About, Blog Posts, and Miscellaneous. 
    It should be noted that the home folder is called WSOA_1595043. 
    The About folder will contain information regarding the purpose of the website. 
    Then the Blog Posts folder will contain each post required throughout the semester. 
    Lastly, the Miscellaneous folder will contain random experiments and fun activities I will be working on as the website is developed. 
</p>
<h3 style="left: auto;">URL scheme</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
    https://github.com/Wits-Digital-Arts-Interactive-Media/WSOA3028_1595043. 
    This will be the home page URL scheme. 
    With each page, it will give them the option to return to the home page or proceed to other web pages that should be found in the same folder as I am trying to avoid having users get confused when searching for their desired content. 
    An example of this is https://wits-digital-arts-interactive-media.github.io/WSOA3028_1595043/about/images.html as an example. 
    However, this URL at the moment is not the same as the specified format so I do apologize for it.

<h4 style="left: auto;"> Wireframe Ideas</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
    My first few ideas for my website regarding its wireframe aim for a simple yet logical order and is not difficult to understand in navigation. 
    For example, here is my blog post wireframe. 
    All the other wireframes will follow a similar style but of course, it is subject to change if necessary or if another style is found. 
    Here is the image:

<h5 style="left: auto;">Conclusion</h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
    In the end both the internet and the World-wide web started of small and simple. 
    Nobody could have imagined that it would become a major backbone of the world today. 
    It has become both a blessing and a curse for every generation of mankind both literally and figuratively. 
    Every person views the World-wide web and internet differently, just like I do but it is here to stay and who knows what will happen next to it.

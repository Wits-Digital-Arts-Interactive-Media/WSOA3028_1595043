    After reading the material I noticed that the choice of wording and context given to the reader is not meant for, at the time, the common person. 
    More rather the wealthier person that worked for tech giants, government engineers or such would be fit for the intended audience that this section in the article “The Global Diffusion of the Internet: Patterns and Problems” [1] talks about.  
    What I mean by this is during the early 90’s to late 90’s, since this was not technology that anyone could access, rather during that time for a household PC, it was a similar in price to that of a car [2][3]. 
    So, with that in mind and being weary of new things being a natural behaviour in human beings, it had not gained global popularity and use till 2010 [4] and even then, it was still small compared to today’s statistics.

    As pointed out by the article, the growth and development of the World-Wide Web was slow and steady but was showing already good promise as recorded by WAIS, Gopher, and CERN. 
    An interesting event to note is that this technology was being found in universities and by technology focused companies like CERN and WAIS. 
    CERN is an international scientific organization that was established for research into high-energy particle physics made use of this technology as it would help benefit their research greatly and WAIS, which were a supercomputer manufacture and AI company, helped this process out as well. 
    However, a growing concern from this was the traffic the system’s experienced which today we know as bytes, mobile data, Wi-Fi, or such that is necessary in order to transfer information. 
    The size started off as only 10 Megabytes, which is nothing compared to today, and slowly started increasing tenfold every month from there on out. 
    Eventually reaching 10 Terabytes from the reading material. 
    Looking further into what that number is today [5] which is 440,000 gigabytes of data that is uploaded to the internet every minute and it is safe to say that that kind of information would have floored people back in early 2000’s and 90’s.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
    Overall, looking at the origin of the World-Wide Web, it should be noted that it was only going to be used as a collection of information, like a Grand Library except anyone with access to the technology can use it anywhere in the world. 
    This in turn would allow access to useful knowledge for a multitude of reasons such as easy access to existing projects of any field, revaluation or appendment of existing information and easy collaboration for future projects or in progress projects world-wide.  
    However, compare it to today’s World-Wide Web purpose and it is no longer just for research and development, but it is now known for recreational purposes, advertisement, news, trade, entertainment and more. 
    Its uniqueness and simple purpose were lost due to the heavy commercialization it received when its existence to corporations and the public became more readily known over the years and its possibilities for what it could do at the time were virtually limitless. 
    Corporation giants like Microsoft and Apple pushed hard for their Web browsers products and communication/PC to become readily available to the public while slowly over time becoming much cheaper and smaller. [2]
</p>
<h4 style="left: auto;">Conclusion</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
    In the end both the internet and the World-wide web started of small and simple. 
    Nobody could have imagined that it would become a major backbone of the world today. 
    It has become both a blessing and a curse for every generation of mankind both literally and figuratively. 
    Every person views the World-wide web and internet differently, just like I do but it is here to stay and who knows what will happen next to it.

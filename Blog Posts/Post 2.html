<h2><u>Structure</u></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify">
    Looking at my folder structure, ill be keeping it as 4 separate folders. 
    One is the home folder containing the following three folders: About, Blog Posts, and Miscellaneous. 
    It should be noted that the home folder is called WSOA_1595043. 
    The About folder will contain information regarding the purpose of the website. 
    Then the Blog Posts folder will contain each post required throughout the semester. 
    Lastly, the Miscellaneous folder will contain random experiments and fun activities I will be working on as the website is developed. 
</p>
<h2><u> URL Scheme</u></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
    https://github.com/Wits-Digital-Arts-Interactive-Media/WSOA3028_1595043. 
    This will be the home page URL scheme. 
    With each page, it will give them the option to return to the home page or proceed to other web pages that should be found in the same folder as I am trying to avoid having users get confused when searching for their desired content. 
    An example of this is https://wits-digital-arts-interactive-media.github.io/WSOA3028_1595043/about/images.html as an example. 
    However, this URL at the moment is not the same as the specified format so I do apologize for it.
</p>
<h2><u> Wireframe Ideas </u></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
    My first few ideas for my website regarding its wireframe aim for a simple yet logical order and is not difficult to understand in navigation. 
    For example, here is my blog post wireframe. 
    All the other wireframes will follow a similar style but of course, it is subject to change if necessary or if another style is found. 
    Looking at it though, it is a bit dull so will be looking into making it appear livelier.
    Here is the image:

<h2><u>Inspirational websites</u></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
    I want to go for a similar colour scheme and flow that the two websites below have, mainly due to their colour choice making it a welcoming feel for each webpage, and the flow of information relies on scrolling instead of having to scour the webpage.
    1.	https://www.hrgreen.com/
    2.	EPC, Engineering, & Technical Services | Audubon (auduboncompanies.com)

<h2><u> WWW and Interaction </u></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
    Regarding the lecture where we discussed this topic, to me interaction can have different styles of response to user's input such as asking for permission or informing the user if they want to go through with their decision. 
    This would be found in scenarios like bank transactions or payments. 
    I do agree with the fact that it requires non-trivial effort to truly be interactive but what if the user who constantly interacts with it becomes oblivious and does it absent-mindedly? 
    This behaviour happens for all people when it comes to repeatedly performing the same task which although originally required non-trivial effort now does not. 
    So then does the process require change or is it the user's fault? 
    All in all , everything has interactivity but there will always be an event or process that requires much more interaction than the rest and this can vary from user to user.

<h2><u> Reading Material </u></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
    Moulthrop, S. (2003) ‘You Say You Want a Revolution? Hypertext and the Laws of Media (1991)’, in N. Wardrip-Fruin and N. Montfort (eds) The New Media Reader. HAR/CDR edition. Cambridge, Mass: The MIT Press.
Regarding the material, it's interesting how when Bush’s projections were realized followed by the creation of Adventure in the 1960, Theodor Holm Nelson gave the concept or term hypertext.
This domino into the creation of FRESS and while furthering technologies, the saying that is commonly found amongst scientists and engineers is “We can but should we?”. 
Because hypertext indeed had quite a lot of political ramifications, only much later than he had thought it would. 
What would have happened had he not introduced hypertext? 
What would today's world look like? 
Would it look like how during the time people thought it would be or would it be retro future like Alien Isolation or Alien itself where hypertext appears to not exist? 
Remember that one small concept which is hypertext had such an impact on information. 
And it had only regained recognition when it was rather no longer a bleeding edge technology. 
It took that long to have an impact and along the way through marketing, developments in technology, new obsessions like cyberspace, Virtual reality and information Highway came about.
Looking at the fact that hypertext was no longer bleeding edge, it is interesting that the realization that current desktops, laptops and such would soon be obsolete “long before we paid for them”. 
Almost like it was designed that way. 
Then comes into play that a revolution is needed ( funny since revolution just means it moves in place, spinning for whatever amount of time only to end up where it started) where we are not sure what we want with the revolution because it is not fully understood. 
This in turn leads to us not knowing what we want from it. 
The text digs further into this part and does a better job of putting forth what I’m trying to get at.
Now after that we look at what hypertext enhances or intensifies and from the text it points out that “The constantly repeated ritual of interaction,
with its reminder of discursive alternatives, reveals the text
as a made thing, not monologic perhaps but hardly
indeterminate. The text gestures toward openness—what
options can you imagine? —but then swiftly forecloses: some
options are available but not others, and someone clearly did
the defining long before you began interacting. The author
persists, undead presence in the literary machine, the
inevitable Hand that turns the time.” 
Hypertext allowed enhancement of information gathering but someone who didn’t create the information did that, not the authors of the information. 
So, it is easily created and manipulated with or without realization and you the reader do not have any choice in discussing whether it is right or wrong because you didn’t put it there, your higher-ups did and who gets to decide which heads do the changing and which get changed? 
You? 
What hypertext renders obsolete is post-literacy. 
Why need books when they could be replicated digitally? 
Then copied, duplicated, and shared a 1000-fold faster and more than a book can while also having a quality that it can never fade away.  
It becomes clear that hypertext introduced death to literature. 
However as stated by the text, Print is not the only means of communication. 
Consider interactive media ‘texts’ that use voice, music etc. and that too could be replaced. 
Or does it? 
It is uncertain and “hypertext could hardly claim to represent ‘a cure for television stupor’.” 
As said by the reading material. 

<h2><u> Conclusion </u></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
    If one were to continue investigating the reading material, it would lead one further down the rabbit hole and out of it at the same time but in the end, I found the text intriguing. 
    It is funny considering one small concept back then which seemed like it shouldn’t have done anything became everything in our day-to-day lives. 
    I wonder then what would today be like had the WWW remained what it originally was. 
    Of course, to someone in this generation, it would be impossible to perceive but back then it would be extremely easy to imagine if it had never evolved into what it is today. 
    Life goes on.

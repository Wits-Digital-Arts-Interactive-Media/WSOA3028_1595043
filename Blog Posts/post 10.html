    <div style="text-align: center;"><h2><u>CSS, that dragon</u></h2></div>
   

    <p style="text-align: justify center;">In regard to CSS and how it relates to my java script and html, the main goals of it is to implement good user navigation and usability. I have seen that it can help out quite a lot in regard to aesthetics for a website but mainly I am focusing on the two features mentioned before that. Now it is in development however from feedback, I will be having to look into changing hyperlinks linking to external sites as this would not create a tab but reload the current page. This creates more work for the user, and this is not desirable.</p>
    
    <div style="text-align: center;"><h2><u>Benefits and Challenges of responsive design </u></h2></div>
   

    <p style="text-align: justify center;">From what I had gathered from the lectures, it is not surprising that when designing a website or webpage or anything involving the web/internet that a designer must take into consideration that any device can handle it. However, this is much easier said than done. It is correct that it allows much easier client usability and navigation and is more convenient for them as they can access it with any device. Yet this then requires additional research into programming the graphics for the website to making it automatically adjust resolution and element placement. This can take time and large adjustments of code as to achieve the same effect that the website or webpage desires psychologically can be limited as now with every hardware, what it can do is different from any other hardware. So, this must then be programmed so that the code is “automatic” in adjustment while changing certain elements to still maintain usability and navigation.  </p>
    
    

    <div style="text-align: center;"><h2><u>Reflection</u></h2></div>
    <p style="text-align: justify center;">In the end, the article shows that internet access is not that simple and is much more complex than one would expect. From what I have gathered, it is clear that research into it Is of the utmost importance as many problems can be found surrounding the topic.</p>

    <div style="text-align: center;"><h1>Week 8 - Blog Post 6</h1></div>
    <div style="text-align: center;"><h1>Internet and the Just Society</h1></div>
    <div style="text-align: center;"><h1>Article: Internet Access is a Fundamental Right</h1></div>
    <div style="text-align: center;"><h3>Student Name: Ettienne Swart</h3></div>
    <div style="text-align: center;"><h3>Student Number: 1595043</h3></div>
    
    <div style="text-align: center;"><h2>Introduction</h2></div>
   
    <p style="text-align: justify center;">For my choice, I have chosen to look into Kasapis, Internet Access is a Fundamental Right [1] as it is interesting in regard to what it can help with and what it can also harm. From experience the internet can be wonderful and terrible. As such, I hope to gain a better understanding from this.</p>
  
    <div style="text-align: center;"><h2>Body</h2></div>
   
    <p style="text-align: justify center;">An interesting thing to note right off the bat of the article is stating its claim on internet access boldly while accompanied by the recent COVID-19 pandemic that is says. This being “Especially, Amidst a Pandemic”. This was posted on 19 May 2020, which was during the high rising tide that was the development of the internet into being more beneficial towards satisfying human needs such as food, exercise, and socializing with other people. Understand that humans [2] are a very social species. They were not made for isolation, so this article chose a good time to state the problem of not having internet access which in turn leads to having limited social access. </p>
    
    <p style="text-align: justify center;">Now it should be noted that during the pandemic, a few human rights had to be adjusted (fitting considering the article is about internet access being a human right) or downright removed temporarily to combat the spread of the virus (which for quite a few countries went poorly as their infrastructure was not made for it). From the problem being blown out of proportions due to false information from the media and many news outlets trying to figure out where it came from, panic ensued and a new age for internet dawned. However, imagine now what it was like for people who didn’t have access to internet or were limited concerning its use and now their only reliable source of information, without being able to confirm it, were authorities who could use this to their benefit. Since such problems can’t be reported or relayed to spread awareness on it, human rights are susceptible. That is why this article makes a valid argument that to ensure happiness for all, internet access can play a major role in ensuring it is achieved. </p>
  
    <p style="text-align: justify center;">As stated in the article, the Western capitalist societies during the pandemic were indeed flourishing as since the law of social distancing that had to be enforced onto people, the stagnation of direct human interactions led to an ever-intensifying digital economic activity. Of course, today this growth is much smaller as many workplaces and companies are starting to make it mandatory to go to work (which if you were to say this to someone before 2020, you would sound outlandish to the average citizen) instead of working at home. This varies from country to country but was a foreseen side effect of ending the ‘lockdown’ as now there is no need to be at home to work, why waste resources on trying to maintain the online work environment for a company? However, getting back on track, it is true that the digital economy during that time was equivalent to a gold rush yet only those who had the tools to do so could profit.  Those who did not, could not work. And for education, this would be an expensive process that was also never meant for large audiences. Online schools were always there but were never used to teach large audiences.</p>
  
    <p style="text-align: justify center;">Now in regard to the article from The New York Time’s [3] where it claims the internet Access is not a human right have many valid points. For one thing, Governments have a lot of power when it comes to what can be seen, done or used on the internet. This can lead to many problems like how in the article, governments clamped down on internet access to quell protestors. They essentially tried to cover up the reasons as to why people should protest in the first place, usually stemming from actual valid reasons to act on. Yet despite all this, it is just a tool, not a right. It as said in the article is an enabler of rights, not a right itself. A human right must provide humans the means to lead healthy, meaningful lives. As mentioned in the article, which is a practice that is unfortunately found in todays world, freedom from torture. If it is valued as a human right, it will eventually corrupt our views as to how we should lead our lives. A great example that comes from the Article [3] is “For example, at one time if you didn’t have a horse, it was hard to make a living. But the important right in that case was the right to make a living, not the right to a horse. Today, if I were granted a right to have a horse, I’m not sure where I would put it.”.</p>
  
    <p style="text-align: justify center;">From both views, it is also among the philosophical category as well. The report [1] focuses quite a lot on economic gains, but mentions other rights such as education, health etc. Yet that is the problem. If this report had gone into further explanation of the above, instead of financial gains which many are fooled into believing that money makes a happy life, then I would agree with it without a shadow of doubt. But I do not agree with the article from The New York Time’s as unfortunately since the internet without proper guidance and management has evolved into what the world is today, it is very difficult to get far in the business world without it. It is a coin toss. On one side, yes financial gain is what everyone wants. Education, labour market etc. is what everyone wants in life. Human beings want to live. Yet if this is done poorly in preventing the view of the internet to become the core to many things in life, then it is a major problem. Because once it disappears, what are people going to do? So, on the other side of the coin, I can agree with the fact that the internet is a means to an end, not an end itself. It is just a tool and a dangerous one at that. As said in the New York Times [3] article:</p>
  
    <p style="text-align: justify center;">“the responsibility of technology creators themselves to support human and civil rights. The Internet has introduced an enormously accessible and egalitarian platform for creating, sharing and obtaining information on a global scale. As a result, we have new ways to allow people to exercise their human and civil rights.</p>
  
    <p style="text-align: justify center;">In this context, engineers have not only a tremendous obligation to empower users, but also an obligation to ensure the safety of users online. That means, for example, protecting users from specific harms like viruses and worms that silently invade their computers. Technologists should work toward this end.”</p>
  
    <div style="text-align: center;"><h2>Conclusion</h2></div>
   
    <p style="text-align: justify center;">In the end, Human beings, through hard times, can do terrible or wonderful things. The internet provides the means to an end, yet it is not a beast that is easily controlled. It can also bring harm to its user. So rather than debate it, we should discuss on how it could be made a “human right” without corrupting our views. I, personally, have no side to whether it should or should not be a “human right” as there are many pros as well as cons.</p>

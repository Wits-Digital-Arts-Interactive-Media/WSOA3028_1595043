    <h2><u>Website Analysis Example</u></h2>
    
    <p style="text-align: justify;">
        This blog post wont be long as i will only be analyzing one website that i found interesting. 
        The website is Alma Maters website and how it is able to reprsent its brand.
    
        Pros:
        1) It makes good use of colour aesthetic for its background as blue represents calm and trustworthiness.
        2) By using good ui elements such as a navigation menu bar that follows, users can easily find their way aorund.
        
        Cons:
        1) The font of the text varies and can be quite cluttered at times which harms the users ability to read.
        2) There can be at times to much content which could be shortened or placed on a sepearate webpage.

        Overall, the site isnt bad and could be improved yet it utilization of UI elements and Colour aesthetics could help me further my own website.

    <p style="text-align: justify center;">Unfortunately, due to not being allowed to use CSS, many of the implementations for my website could not be done as they required css. I originally was struggling with the Javascript navigation till i recoginized patterns and figured out that although JS works on the website, it does not work on my machine, which was annoying since that wasted my time in trying to figure out why. Nonetheless, the list below explains what i have implemented in the website: </p>
    
    <p style="text-align: justify;">
        <h3>Navigation of Blog and Essay pages</h3>
            <ul>
            <li>By using a Javascript navigation function, i was able to make it so that on all webpages, the user can navigate to any other relevant webpage. This was also implemented for blog posts so that users do not have to waste time trying to find their desired post.</li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Normal navigation( Nicknamed Realtime, none of that hyperlink)</h3>
            <ul>
            <li>Not having to have multiple hyperlink on the pages helped a lot in programming as it could easily get cluttered. Although admiteddly as mentioned earlier, it took me quite a while to figure out what i was doing wrong. It boiled down to spelling mistakes and the fact that my computer will show the navigation, it just leads to a 404 page but the website did work all along during the whole time. </li>
            </ul>
    </p>

    <p style="text-align: justify center;">Thankfully though that with the functions built and tested, the elements now can be easily called again in future updates or changes.</p>
    
    <p style="text-align: justify;">
        <h3>Features that could not be implemented due to no css allowed</h3>
            <ul>
            <li>Side bar navigation page with animations</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
            <li>Creating a layout so to speak. Think like a table with parts varying in size. This was to create a more orderly, engineer like website and UI. </li>
            </ul>
    </p>

    <div style="text-align: center;"><h2><u>Reflection on Reading</u></h2></div>
    <p style="text-align: justify center;"> Material: <cite>https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.14258</cite></p>
    <p style="text-align: justify center;">Although i am not in those minority groups , i will say that this article was quite an interesting read.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify center;">"rejection of the idea that centering individual people is a solution to system-level problems. The longer we ignore these two steps, the more “our” academic system maintains its toxic structure, excludes, and harms Black women and other minoritised groups." Starting off strong with the abstract and quite an eye catcher as for anybody who knows about social psychology and the research behind it, this is a practice that can be done either with good intent or malicious intent, it still stands that too see a system focus on the small picture instead of the bigger picture ( focusing on one PoC instead of the other) can lead to problems. As i see it, treat everyone the same, design it to be human and work for all, not just some. Though you might think i am talking about assuming , no rather i am talking about design knowing that they are human and can do it. </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify center;">Looking at the section named "The computational sciences ecosystem", quite a lot of evidence is shown involving 'white supremacy' which i will not deny that there are people who use this idelogy or mindset of theirs quite often, not everyone does this and most of the time, the suspects have quite interesting backgrounds or are quite wealthy. Though if action is not taken, this will lead to many more problems down the line.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify center;">Next is "A tale of two academias" where funny enough regarding the depixiliser image (Figure 2), this is actually happening with an Ai image generator from Google called Gemini whose creator is without a doubt very problematic. They purposefully programmed it to ensure that whatever you request regarding people, you will most likely never get an image of a white person, even going as far to telling you that if you do try, it basically calls you the problem. No problem though if you ask for any other skin colour, also it fabricates nonsense in regards to culture and such, straight up ignoring what people actually looked like at that time.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify center;">"White woman are apart of the problem" Damn, now i don't know about you but that title is 'interesting'.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify center;">In the conclusion section, it is fair. That to say there are problems that are deep rooted in society, and should be fixed. Action can speak louder than words but can also drown the goals you had in the first place if not done right. Hopefully action is taken but personally this document had strong and weak points but some parts like saying "White woman are the problem" going against what they are trying to prove. Lack of a better word , i know but hoepfully the authors understand that not everyone does what they say are doing.  </p>

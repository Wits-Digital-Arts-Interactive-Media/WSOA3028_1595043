<h2><u>Interaction Design</u></h2> 
<p style="text-align: center justify"itemprop="description">
    After going through the lectures, my user alignment for my website will be that I only want users to see my blog posts, some information about the website and its purpose, and my experiments in HTML and CSS.
</p>
<p style="text-align: center justify"itemprop="description">
    What I want users to do is to easily find the blog posts and experiments so to do so I had to consider what the target audience is. 
    My target audience should be teenagers to adults who are mainly engineers so because of this going for a flashy artistic website is not a good idea. 
    However, that is not what I am aiming for. 
    The website style will be simple style like YouTube in black and white with a light green background.
</p>     
<p style="text-align: center justify"itemprop="description">
    Why they want to be on this website depends on the user. 
    If they simply want to see my development by examining the blog posts then it is very easy to find and maneuver through all the existing blog posts through a scroll bar at the top of the page. 
    If they want to review it, it should easily meet the expectation of being simple and easy to use. 
    What should also happen is that what they want to see are blog posts and About information. 
    If they are interested in seeing the experiments that I have been doing on the side, then It is very easy to access through the index page.
</p>   
<h2><u>Content & Experience</u></h2>
<p style="text-align: center justify"itemprop="description">
    Starting at the index page, the site should display my blog posts, about, portfolio, and experiments. 
    So right off the bat, it is a simple introduction. 
    The user should have an easy experience, exploring an easy-on-the-eyes website where it isn’t a maze to figure out where to go.
</p>
<h2><u>Interface Elements</u></h2>   
<p style="text-align: center justify"itemprop="description">
    Keeping in mind that a simple and easy-to-use website is desired, I will be focusing on proper word style, layout, headings, strong text, and such. 
    I won't be using anything that changes the text but does not help in getting whatever the text’s point is across. 
    Although this might change depending on my wireframe for the website.
</p>
<h2><u>Reflection on Structure, URL, and Semantic</u></h2>  
<p style="text-align: center justify"itemprop="description">
    Regarding the text above where I discussed my website's overall appearance and purpose, I am quite grateful that I started off keeping my folder structure simple, like that of a hallway where it is clearly stated where the user is E.G my structure is like this: About/about.html or About/images.html, whereas other structure I have seen look something like this Home/About/Blog/About.html and Home/Blog/image/image.html , the latter example does not maintain clarity and has things in needless positions. 
    However, in much bigger projects, this structure is used. 
    It all depends on what you want for the user in the end. 
    From this then, my URL scheme is simple and clear as well as fully displayed as to where the user is instead of the typical approach to shortening the URL to look like this: www.website.comLinks to an external site. where you are 2 folder levels deep, mine is WSOA3028_1595043/ and whatever folder there is on the website displayed. 
    However, both have their advantages and disadvantages, like if the user is looking for something specific but they do not know where it is in the folder structure then there is no point in having my URL scheme, and it’s the opposite for those who do know where it is in the folder structure and can manually type it in instead of wandering through the webpages.
</p>
<h2><u>Development Reflection</u></h2>
<p style="text-align: center justify"itemprop="description">
    My overall progress for this week is admittedly dissatisfying. 
    I am mainly referring to my website as I have managed to sort out my website in its folder structure and where its respective content goes but without CSS to allow us to customize our web pages to our desired wireframe specifications, it is underwhelming. 
    However, as we were informed in class, our website is supposed to be barren and dead simple, I am not that bothered with it but it will be interesting to see what can be done with it when we get to that point. 
    Then regarding our lecture material, I find it fascinating that our website can wield a lot of influence over our users depending on only a few factors. 
    This saddens me as I do know of websites where it is used maliciously but as they say don’t blame a good tool, blame its bad user. 
    In the end, I have had a blast so far developing my website and experimenting with it. 
    I look forward to learning more about UI and UX as well as CSS.

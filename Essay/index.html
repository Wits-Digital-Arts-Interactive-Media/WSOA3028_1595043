    <p style="text-align: justify center;"><b>Abstract— In this report, Alma Mater’s website is both discussed and analyzed regarding its UI and UX. It will document all aspects of its design and then deliberate regarding each aspect of the ethics behind each design decision.</b></p>

    <p style="text-align: justify center;">The assignment given to us had us choose a South African website that would be of interest to furthering our goals for our website. Alma Mater's [1] use of relaying information, style choices and interaction had me intrigued as I believed it would benefit me. However, through further inspection of the website, there were issues regarding both UI and UX which will be discussed below. When starting the assignment, I, the Author, had adequate knowledge regarding some of the concepts concerning UI and UX. However certain concepts like unnecessary or large amounts of information were difficult as I, the Author, find it acceptable. As such parts where this occurs are discussed and give both the pros and cons to it. Do note that this report mainly focused on the PC version of the website, but phone versions of the website are discussed in UX.</p>

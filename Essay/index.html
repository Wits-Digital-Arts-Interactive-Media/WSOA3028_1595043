    <p style="text-align: justify center;"><b>Abstract— In this report, Alma Mater’s website is both discussed and analyzed regarding its UI and UX. It will document all aspects of its design and then deliberate regarding each aspect of the ethics behind each design decision.</b></p>
    <div style="text-align: center;"><h3>I.	Introduction and Literature Review</h3></div>
    <p style="text-align: justify center;">The assignment given to us had us choose a South African website that would be of interest to furthering our goals for our website. Alma Mater's [1] use of relaying information, style choices and interaction had me intrigued as I believed it would benefit me. However, through further inspection of the website, there were issues regarding both UI and UX which will be discussed below. When starting the assignment, I, the Author, had adequate knowledge regarding some of the concepts concerning UI and UX. However certain concepts like unnecessary or large amounts of information were difficult as I, the Author, find it acceptable. As such parts where this occurs are discussed and give both the pros and cons to it. Do note that this report mainly focused on the PC version of the website, but phone versions of the website are discussed in UX.</p>

    <div style="text-align: left;"><h3>B.	UI Analysis</h3></div>
    <div style="text-align: left;"><h4>Colour Contrast Analysis, Section A</h4></div>
    <p style="text-align: justify center;">In Fig. 1, users are welcomed with a mix of hard blue and soft blue colours contrasted with a white background. Throughout the website, this colour choice is commonly found and used with a variety of different shades of blue and grey when informing the user of certain topics or contexts. The text throughout the website itself uses black when accompanied by a light blue or white background, white when accompanied by a blue background, black when it is a grey background, and white when accompanied by a black background. Lastly, all images and videos used throughout the website have a common trend of containing blue, red, and white.</p>
    <div style="text-align: left;"><h4>Colour Discussion, Section B</h4></div>
    <p style="text-align: justify center;">From Section A we can see that good use of colour theory is in effect. For one thing, I, the Author, had gone to Alma Mater for my primary and high school education, and I can say for certain that blue is used as a brand representation. Alma Mater prides itself on trust and honour when it comes to education. They always try to help their students so using blue in their brand which from colour theory [2] is a good choice as it helps visitors believe that the business (school in this context) is stable, and peaceful which helps reassure the financial security and confidence in the future of the student. From what can be gathered, blue represents professionalism which is expected of a Cambridge school. Expertise is known for Cambridge schools, and I, the Author, having studied there for 12 years can confirm this. Then concerning black and white foreground on grey, white, or blue background respectively, it can work. However, contrast plays a strong role [3] and although white text on a blue background is good, black text on a grey background is poor as it can lead to eyestrain. Now it can work in certain instances as throughout the website, a grey background is not used often, mainly different shades of blue. From this, the website knows what its audience wants and that is a trustworthy, expert school that can ensure a good future for the student. This is exhibiting known patterns and behaviours that all schools should have. The use of colours is consistent and not random which helps in guiding users through the website. Overall, it does its job well regarding the aesthetic part of websites. As discussed here [4], there is a good use of Visual Hierarchy. The use of contrast is done well at most points and its balance of hierarchy regarding images, videos and text is done well. Now although there is the usage of a lot of blue, they do come in different shades and there is the use of other contrasting colours as stated earlier. Overall, the design is simple and not complex or loud and achieves its goal well. </p>
    <div style="text-align: left;"><h4>UI Core Pricniples Analysis and Discussion, Section C</h4></div>
    <p style="text-align: justify center;">In Fig. 1, users’ attentions are grabbed by both the colour theory as discussed before and professionalism regarding the style and layout of the website. For instance, the navigational menu bar at the top right of the website will follow the user when scrolling the webpage and uses drop-down bars which allows users to find information quickly. Another aspect is that on PC, the web page UI is adaptable as instead of using full screen if made smaller, it turns the navigational menu bar into a drop-down bar that still follows the users when scrolling. Next is the use of web page links (buttons). They always are accompanied by a soft shape, black background, and white text. They stand out well but also are placed well regarding whether the user is, such as a certain set of text that discusses subjects, the buttons are found directly after it which gives the user ease of access and convenience. An example can be found in Fig. 3. However, there are times when the same shape or style of button is used that does not do anything. This might mislead users into thinking that they are links to other parts of the website. This can lead to a confusing experience for users at times if they are looking for something specific. An example is in Fig. 4. </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify center;"> In Fig. 5, if there is content missing such as sports events or such, the website does inform the user. Throughout navigating the website, I did not personally feel lost as the navigation bar on the top helped. Another navigation bar to note is the blue and white symbols on the side that expand when hovered over in Fig. 1. Now this is clever as if a user is interested in applying for the school after reading through the context, they never have to look far to find say the school fees, brochure, application etc. Now this is a good use of navigation as it is convenient for the user. </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify center;">In Fig. 2, the image shows the text size and font commonly found throughout the website. It is a simple, clear font and is readable. However, it is a bit small and looking at how there can be quite a lot of text on screen at times, might hurt user readability. Another problem to note is that in some parts the font size is smaller and slightly cramped. An example can be seen in Fig. 6. This could be rectified by using another web page or changing the layout style so that it can present the information in a much more readable format. </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify center;">Lastly is the website's negative space. Throughout the website, there is content placed well and does not feel as if it is cramped altogether. There are moments when it is empty, but it does not hurt the website's goal at all. Overall, the website's UI core principles are achieved well with only minor flaws that can easily be fixed </p>

    <div style="text-align: center;"><h3>III. UX Discussion</h3></div>
    <div style="text-align: left;"><h3>a.	UX Experience Phone</h3></div>
    <p style="text-align: justify center;">From the analysis and discussions above, it is safe to say that the website is performing well when it comes to UI. Now note that on the phone version of the website, the UI is changed to fit on a smaller screen. An example is as stated earlier in UI Core Principles Analysis where if the page is made smaller the navigation bar is made into a drop-down bar. This same method is also used for the phone. This works well as if they tried to keep it the same, it would not work or would be too small to be effective at all. Then the content of each page is the same, but the layout and placement are changed. Rather it is much more list-like when it comes to it. The website itself does not take long to load, there is not much difference to its PC version other than what was stated before and overall performs its job well. An image of this can be found in Fig. 7. </p>
    <div style="text-align: left;"><h3>b.	UX Experience PC</h3></div>
    <p style="text-align: justify center;">Although UI is important, it is not as important as ensuring the UX is achieved. As such a guide will be referred to [5] as to what the website does right and wrong. From experience, the website does keep its user in mind however will still need to fix or change certain aspects like text size and quantity of text. Then regarding Usability and Accessibility, there may be some issues like text readability, button shapes misleading users and sometimes tightly packed text however it still meets its requirements. Now the website does maintain most of its consistency regarding UI components like buttons and images however concerning things like text or decoration, it varies from time to time. It can range from text size to colour contrasting but could easily be fixed so is not that much of a problem. Next is regarding how some pages of the website can have quite a lot of over-decoration while others have much less. Now the latter is what should be kept in mind, meeting your goal but keeping it simple will always help as it will improve consistency and usability. Then comes the amount of control that users have and there is not much when it comes to navigating to previous pages, mainly relying on the built-in browser page navigation or the navigation bar at the top right of the screen however for things like closing videos or cancelling a process these at least are found on the website. Overall, the UX performs fine but can be improved to ensure a better website experience for users. </p>

    <div style="text-align: center;"><h3>IV. Ethics and Design</h3></div>
    <p style="text-align: justify center;">From the analysis and discussions above, it can be safely said that the ethics behind the design choices carry no ill intent and have the user in mind. It performs its purpose well in providing information regarding the school and represents its brand well through its design choices. Overall, this website is a good example of what to do and what not to do. In future, I, the author, will be using this website's clever use of colours and navigation as inspiration to help further my website's goals.  </p>

    <div style="text-align: center;"><h3>V. Conclusion</h3></div>
    <p style="text-align: justify center;">In the end, the choice of website to analyse proved fruitful to both understanding web design core concepts and helping further my own goals as well. Although having some minor flaws, I am glad that the place of education in my youth ensures that its website meets the same standards as its education. I enjoyed this assignment and hope to be able to do more assignments like this in the future.  </p>

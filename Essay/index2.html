    <p style="text-align: center justify"itemprop="description"><b>Abstract— In this essay, Digital colonialism is both discussed and its effect on the rest of the world. It will go through the issues of labour in global software development, South Africa software development industry and my, the Author’s, responsibilities in it.</b></p>
   
    <div style="text-align: center;"><h2>I.	Introduction</h2></div>
    
    <p style="text-align: center justify"itemprop="description">The assignment given to us had us explore Digital Colonialism and relate it to the software development industry and how it will cause major economic issues for third world countries all due to stronger tech companies and nations dominating and exploiting their digital resources, data and technological infrastructure. This can evolve into having strong economical, social and political control. To help understand and explore this issue further, the list below contains all content to follow.</p>
   
    <ol>
        <li>Digital Colonialism</li>
        <li>Global Labour Situation and South Africa</li>
        <li>Understanding and Role, Conclusion</li>
    </ol>
    
    <div style="text-align: center;"><h2>II.	Digital Colonialism</h2></div>

    <div style="text-align: left;"><h3>A.	What is it?</h3></div>

    <p style="text-align: center justify"itemprop="description">In Digital colonialism, stronger nations or Tech companies carry out the practice of dominating and exploiting digital resources, data and technological infrastructure of less powerful nations. These are most of the time developing countries/ Third world countries like Mexico or India who is commonly known for a large hotspot in software related labour. This is just a modern version of historical colonialism where powerful countries exploited the resources and people of colonized regions for their own benefit.  It raises important ethical and political questions in the digital age. To address these issues will require international cooperation, stronger regulatory frameworks and efforts to build local digital capacities and infrastructures in developing nations. The key aspects of these are the following: </p>
    
    <ol>
        <li>Data Extraction and Exploitation</li>
        <li>Infrastructure Control</li>
        <li>Economic Dominance</li>
        <li>Cultural Influence</li>
        <li>Legal and Regulatory Challenges</li>
        <li>Digital Divide</li>
    </ol>
    
    
    <div style="text-align: left;"><h3>B.	Data Extraction and Exploitation</h3></div>
    
    <p style="text-align: center justify"itemprop="description">Data extraction and exploitation refer to where large amounts of data are collected which range from personal information to ergonomic data which are very valuable to the developed countries or corporations. However this is done through the fact that by offering these services or software through economics, a much larger consumer population can be found, and this allows much more data to be analysed/processed and monetized except this is for developed countries and not intended to benefit the local populations where the data was collected from and often results in inadequate (or non-existent) compensation. Keeping this information in mind, the data can then be used to influence political outcomes (advertising, malicious redirection of social media sites like only allowing certain websites to be seen etc), market trends (users like this feature e.g. Ridiculous camera quality on phones (except everything else is worse), advertise more of this product than others etc.) and social behaviours like TikTok which is about to be banned in America as sufficient evidence shows that not only is it a massive security issue [1] for any user as it can easily violate privacy laws and is collecting data on mass, but it also has played a major role in heavily influencing new/newer generations. The new/newer generations have been doing questionable (or downright disgusting) acts as well as TikTok has intentionally been designed to actively degrade a user’s psychological habits like attention span [2]. All in all, with such tools and resources, it easily gives these malicious entities power that they should not have.</p>
    
    <div style="text-align: left;"><h3>C.	Infrastructure Control</h3></div>

    <p style="text-align: center justify"itemprop="description">Regarding infrastructure control, developed nations and large corporations can still make more profit off developing countries as they can provide the tools to help “develop” them further except this is more harmful than beneficial. They often provide the digital infrastructure (such as internet cables, data centres etc.) in these developing countries which in turn if left unchecked or unregulated can mature into full blown dependency on these digital needs since they cannot (or wont) develop their own which in turn gives full control over to the developed countries or large corporations economic wise (they can hike their prices up, add additional clauses to their contracts etc.).</p>
    
    <div style="text-align: left;"><h3>D.	Economic Dominance</h3></div>
    
    <p style="text-align: center justify"itemprop="description">Now knowing how much control these entities have, they can cause quite a severe competition for local business and economies who may struggle in competing against the financial and technological power these entities have. </p>
    
    <div style="text-align: left;"><h3>E.	Cultural Influence</h3></div>

    <p style="text-align: center justify"itemprop="description"> Now another issue that can arise from Digital Colonialism is what effect the content and platforms provided by tech giants have on the local cultures and languages. They usually reflect the values and norms of their country of origin onto others which can potentially undermine others. Now what this means is that there is a risk of homogenization of culture where local traditions and practices are overshadowed by the global digital content. A great example is TikTok which has led to teaching recent generations to perform as previously mentioned, questionable or disgusting acts which for a long time were not really apparent. It should be noted though that there were always individuals doing this and software like TikTok just helped in both finding and creating them. There are many examples of such things occurring and action must be taken soon to avoid this becoming a much bigger issue.   </p>
    
    <div style="text-align: left;"><h3>F.	Legal and Regulatory</h3></div>
    
    <p style="text-align: center justify"itemprop="description">Next come the legal and regulation issues from Digital Colonialism. Developing nations may lack the necessary legal and regulatory frameworks to manage and protect their digital resources and data sovereignty. What this means is every country has different laws when it comes to digital resources and data. So, if a country were to have a law which says it is fine with using both public and private information of any data found within the country for any reason, if there is data being collected from other countries that don’t do that and stored in that said country, this circumvents those local laws and can lead to many issues ethic wise. Powerful tech companies often do this to circumvent those local laws or even influence legislation to favour their own interests.   </p>
    
    <div style="text-align: left;"><h3>G.	Digital Divide</h3></div>

    <p style="text-align: center justify"itemprop="description">Lastly another side effect of Digital Colonialism which itself requires multiple essays going into what exactly happens and why is the Digital Divide created by offering countries who they themselves can’t sustain/create a digital infrastructure in the first place most likely due to economic reasons (which in turn could have financially strained citizens who can’t afford such services). In doing so the few who can afford those newly found services help further in creating a larger divide amongst citizens digital wise. So now developing countries may struggle to keep up with rapid technological advancements which widen the gap between them and developed countries. </p>

    <div style="text-align: center;"><h2>III. Global Labour Situation and South Africa</h2></div>

    <div style="text-align: left;"><h3>A.	What is the issue?</h3></div>

    <p style="text-align: center justify"itemprop="description">The issue with this that Digital Colonialism is like a gold rush where now a large untapped resource of cheap labour is available in developing countries. The large tech companies or developed countries are now using this to their advantage. And South Africa is heavily influenced by Digital Colonialism [3] today so to help explain what they both have in common; the list below mentions what issues there are. </p>

    <ol>
        <li>Labour Arbitrage and Outsourcing</li>
        <li>Skill and Wage Disparities</li>
        <li>Job quality and Career Growth</li>
    </ol>

    <div style="text-align: left;"><h3>B.	Labour Arbitrage and Outsourcing</h3></div>
    
    <p style="text-align: center justify"itemprop="description">Developed countries often outsource software development jobs/tasks to developing countries where labour is much cheaper. This can lead to job creation in those regions except it can, if measures are not taken, result in exploitation due to significant wage disparities and poor working conditions. Especially with South Africa where many countries currency is vastly stronger than the Rand. However cheap labour does not guarantee high quality product, in fact the firms that are outsourcing the jobs might face pressure in ensuring they deliver high quality work at lower costs which will often lead to longer working hours and a larger sense of job insecurity, which in South Africa is already an issue as unemployment rate is 32.9% [4].  </p>

    <div style="text-align: center;"><h3>C. Skill and Wage Disparities</h3></div>

    <p style="text-align: center justify"itemprop="description">Now understand that with developed and developing countries, working conditions and wages are quite different, and this is no different when it comes to Software Development. Developers in developing nations might receive less than half of what their counterparts in developed nations earn for similar or exact same work. This raises many ethical issues and shows the flaws in the economy of today.   </p>

    <div style="text-align: center;"><h3>D. Job quality and Career Growth</h3></div>

    <p style="text-align: center justify"itemprop="description">Lastly is the difference in Job quality where Software developers in developing countries will have fewer opportunities for advancing their personal careers whereas those in developed countries will. This will result in a talent drain where skilled developers will leave the developing countries for better opportunities. Then through outsourcing low-cost labour, this can limit the scope of work that they can do so rather they can deal with less innovative and lower end tasks. This stunts growth for those local developers. </p>

    <div style="text-align: center;"><h2>IV. Understanding and Role, Conclusion</h2></div>

    <p style="text-align: center justify"itemprop="description">From what has been shown in the essay, Digital Colonialism will be the downfall of many If no sufficient or effective actions are taken to combat it. What needs to be done is to push forward investment in education for local developers regarding their skills and knowledge, otherwise they will constantly be left behind in the dust. To do this, we can aim for the help of local global tech companies to help with this. Then another way would be to develop a more robust regulatory framework to help protect the rights of software developers and ensure fair compensation. These are only a few ways that can be done to combat Digital colonialism and hopefully this essay can bring light to the importance of the situation.</p>
